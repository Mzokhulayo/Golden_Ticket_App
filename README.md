This is an application designed for Golden Ticket  driving school, catering to two user roles: Learners and Admins. Here are the outlined functions for each user type:

For Learners:

User Registration: New learners can create an account by providing their Name, Email, Phone, Address, and Date of Birth. During registration, learners also select a Username and set a password for future logins.

Profile Updates: Learners have the capability to modify their personal information, allowing them to change their address, phone number, and other relevant details.

Progress Overview: Learners can view their progress within the course. This overview takes the form of a grid, displaying all course modules. Learners can see which modules they have completed, track their current status, and view payment information.

For Admins:

Learners List: Admins have access to a list of learners with filtering options:

Unenrolled learners
Learners who haven't taken night driving lessons
All learners
Enrollment: Admins can enroll learners by selecting specific learners from the unenrolled list. This action assigns all relevant courses to the learner with default values (e.g., Status – Not Done, Units Taken – 0, Amount Paid – 0).

Progress Updates: Admins can search for specific learners by name or by selecting a particular row in the grid. They can then update the values associated with the courses enrolled for that learner.

Course Details Management: Admins have the authority to modify course details. This includes editing course names, adjusting prices, and updating offered dates, among other details.

Viewing Details: Admins can select a specific row from the list and access detailed information associated with that entry.

This application streamlines the management of learners' progress and allows administrators to efficiently oversee and administer driving courses.
